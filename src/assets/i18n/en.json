      "text": "I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer from Trivandrum, India, with over 7 years of experience ensuring that technology not only works but works well. My journey began in customer support, where I learned the value of empathy, problem-solving, and understanding how real people interact with products. Over time, that curiosity evolved into a career in software testing - from manual checks to automation frameworks, from functional validation to performance and scalability.\n\nI've always been fascinated by the intersection of human experience and technology. Testing, for me, isn't just about finding bugs - it's about creating trust in the systems people rely on every day. Whether it's financial compliance software, property management systems, or global distribution platforms, my goal is to make sure technology feels seamless, reliable, and humane.\n\nToday, I focus on test automation, API validation, and performance testing, helping teams release faster without compromising quality. Along the way, I've led QA initiatives, mentored junior engineers, and collaborated across functions to improve workflows and CI/CD pipelines."
